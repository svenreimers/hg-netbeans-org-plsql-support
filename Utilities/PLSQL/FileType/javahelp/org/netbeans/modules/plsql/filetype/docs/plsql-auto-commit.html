      <p>By default, transactions are committed automatically. But in a command window, users have the option to control the commit/rollback actions with Auto Commit - ON / OFF button.</p>
      
      <p>User needs to commit the transactions, in order to make permanent all changes performed.
         When the Auto-Commit button is in "ON" state, the executing step will commit the transactions automatically. Otherwise, user needs to type the
         command "COMMIT" or "ROLLBACK" and then execute.
         This will commit/rollback all the transactions for that particular session.
